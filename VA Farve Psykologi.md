Color psychology is the study of colors and hues as a determinant of human behavior.
Colors have qualities that can cause certain emotions in people. How color influences
individuals may differ depending on age, gender, and culture. Although color associations 
can vary contextually between cultures, color preference is thought to be relatively
uniform across gender and race.

Color psychology is also widely used in marketing and branding. Marketers see color 
as an important factor, since color can influence a consumers' emotions and perceptions
about goods and services Logos for companies are important, since the logos can attract
more customers.

The field of color psychology applies to many other domains such as medical therapy, 
sports, hospital settings, and even in game design. Carl Jung has been credited as one 
of the pioneers in this field for his research on the properties and meanings of color 
in our lives. According to Jung, "colours are the mother tongue of the subconscious."

### Taste
-Color affects how people perceive the edibility and flavor of foods and drinks. Packaging 
decorated or tinted with golden or brown tones to promote the idea of home-baked and oven 
freshness.

-People can mistake a cherry-flavored drink for being lime or lemon flavored if that drink 
was a green color. Additionally, a flavor can be intensified by a color.

-People can rate a brown M&M as more chocolate flavored than a green M&M based on color.

-UK demonstrated that individuals receiving a brown drink would have different expectations 
for the taste (i.e. expecting a Cola) while someone from Taiwan may expect a grape-flavored
drink because popular brown colored drinks in their culture are typically grape-flavored.

### Time
-Recent studies showed that the perceived duration of a red screen was longer than that 
of a blue screen. The results reflected sex differences; men overestimated the duration of 
the red screen. Additionally, the reaction times to a red screen were faster than those to 
a blue screen. Participants who reacted quickly to a red screen overestimated its duration.
In a demo with 150 people chosen at random, it was found that inside a pod bathed in blue 
color the average perceived duration of a minute was 11 seconds shorter than in a pod bathed 
in red color. However, another study looking at perceived duration found opposite results
regarding blue and red stimuli.

### Light

-The color of a light source affects the apparent color of an object the light shines on.
For example, the color of an object might appear different in the light from the sun versus
from an incandescent (tungsten) light bulb. With the incandescent light bulb, the object might 
appear more orange or "brownish", and dark colors might look even darker.

-Light and the color of an object can affect how one perceives its positioning. If light or
shadow, or the color of the object, masks an object's true contour (outline of a figure) it
can appear to be shaped differently from reality.

-Blue light causes people to feel relaxed, which has led countries to add blue street lights
in order to decrease suicide rates. A railroad company in Japan installed blue lighting on 
its stations in October 2009 in an effort to reduce the number of rail suicide attempts,
although the effect of this technique has been questioned. In 2000, the city of Glasgow 
installed blue street lighting in certain neighborhoods and subsequently reported the anecdotal
finding of reduced crime in these areas.

-Lighting color could also have a strong effect on perceived experience in stores and other
situation. For example, time seems to pass more slowly under red lights and time seems to pass
quickly under blue light. Casinos take full advantage of this phenomenon by using color to
get people to spend more time and hence more money in their casino. However, a presumed 
influence of colored light (red vs. blue) on risk behavior could not be demonstrated.

### Medicine

-The color of placebo pills is reported to be a factor in their effectiveness, with "hot-colored"
(red, yellow, etc.) pills working better as stimulants and "cool-colored" (blue, purple, etc.) 
pills working better as depressants. This relationship is believed to be a consequence of the 
patient's expectations and not a direct effect of the color itself. Consequently, these 
effects appear to be culture-dependent.

One study found that changing the original color of an antiepileptic pill increased the risk of
in-adherence to the medication in patients diagnosed with a seizure disorder.

-Blue and green may be due to a preference for certain habitats that were beneficial in the ancestral 
environment as explained in evolutionary aesthetics. Orange, yellow, and brown are the least popular 
colors, respectively.

-One theory for why people prefer one color over another is called ecological valence theory (EVT) 
proposed by Stephen Palmer and Karen Schloss. This theory asserts that people tend to like or 
dislike colors based on their associations of the color to other objects or situations that they 
have strong feelings about. For example, if someone associates the color blue with clean water, 
they would be more likely to favor blue. On the other hand, people's dislike of the color brown 
could be due to associations of it with feces or rotten food.

-Color preference may also depend on ambient temperature. People who are cold often select warm 
colors such as red or yellow, while people who are hot favor cool colors like blue and green.
Introverted individuals are also found to be more attracted to cool colors, while extroverts 
prefer warmer colors.

-Psychologist Andrew J. Elliot tested to see if the color of a person's clothing could make them 
appear more sexually appealing. He found heterosexual men and women dressed in red were significantly
more likely to attract romantic attention than women dressed in any other color. The color did not 
affect heterosexual women's assessment of other women's attractiveness. Other studies have shown men
dressed in red appeal to heterosexual women.

-Since each person has their own unique method of perceiving color, there are a variety of color 
temperatures that will work well for certain tasks. Neutral and soft white is a friendly and clean
light best for kitchens and bathrooms or any kind of workspace; cool light is adequate for offices,
hospitals, and other commercial uses; and warm light creates a cozy, calm, inviting atmosphere that
is ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms, dining rooms, and other spaces requiring an 
intimate, personal mood.
